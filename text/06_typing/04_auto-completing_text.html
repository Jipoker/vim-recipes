<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to be able to type the start of a word and then have Vim complete
it. For example, you want to type <i>multip</i>, be offered suggestions for
words that start that way, then pick one.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To auto-complete a word Vim needs a list of possible words.  An obvious
source is the current file(s). If your file already contains the word
<i>multiplicand</i>, then Vim can use it to auto-complete <i>multip</i>.
Simply hit <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd></kbd> after the <i>p</i>
to complete the word. If multiple matches are found you'll be presented with a
list from which to choose from.</p>

<p>Another source of words is a dictionary. Get one, using the sidebar for
reference, then point Vim to it with <tt>:set
dictionary=<var>file</var></tt>. Then add the dictionary to list of places
Vim looks for words: <tt>:set complete+=k</tt>. The <tt>'complete'</tt>
options controls where Vim looks for possible matches.</p>

  <p>If you specify your language with <tt>:set
    spelllang=<var>lang-code</var></tt>, e.g. <tt>:set spelllang=it</tt> for
  Italian, Vim <i>should</i> automatically download the correct dictionary for
  you and set it up. If this doesn't work for you see <tt>:help spell</tt> and
  <a
    href="http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/spell/README.txt"><tt>vim/runtime/spell/README.txt</tt></a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Auto-complete can also be used to lookup synonyms for the current word. Get
a thesaurus file, then instruct Vim to use it with <tt>:set thesaurus=<var>file</var></tt>,
<tt>:set complete+=s</tt>.</p>

<p><kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd></kbd>
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd></kbd> searches for the filename that
starts with the text before the cursor. If one is found, it is inserted before
the cursor. If multiple filenames are found, a drop down list is displayed to
choose between them.</p>

  <p>Eric Van Dewoestine's <a
    href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643"><tt>SuperTab</tt></a>
  plugin lets you use the <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> key to auto-complete text.
  You select the type of completion that you want using
  <tt>:SuperTabHelp</tt>, then just hit <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> after a word
  to see a drop-down menu of completion choices.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Vim can use pretty much any word source imaginable. Consult <tt>:help
  ins-completion</tt> for more details.</p>

<p>Vim version 7 and above supports <i>Omni-Completion</i>, which allows
custom functions to generate possible completions dynamically. Even better,
for programmers at least, is that some popular programming languages already
have Omni-Completion functions which are enabled automatically. These typically
allow context-sensitive completion of method names, objects, and reserved
words. For example, using Ruby I can type an integer, a period, then invoke
Omni-Completion to find that <em>Fixnum</em> objects support methods such as
<tt>%</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>+</tt>.</p>

<p>Languages that don't have <i>Omni-Complete</i> functions available can use
their syntax highlighting definitions to achieve a similar affect. The Vim
documentation suggests adding the following stanza to your <a
  href="#configuring-vim"><tt>vimrc</tt></a>, after any <tt>:filetype</tt>
command, to enable <i>Omni-Completion</i> using the best available method:
</p>

<pre><code>if has("autocmd") &amp;&amp; exists("+omnifunc")            
  autocmd Filetype *
    \   if &amp;omnifunc == "" |
    \     setlocal omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete |
    \   endif
endif</code></pre>

<p>To use Omni-Completion hit <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd></kbd> to be presented with a list of choices for
the text behind the cursor.</p>

<p>Apart from programming languages, Omni-Completion also works for HTML and
CSS.  For example, you can type <kbd>&lt;p cl</kbd>,
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>x</kbd></kbd>
<kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd></kbd>, then be shown <samp>class="
  CDATA</samp>, <samp>onclick=" Script</samp>, and <samp>ondblclick="
  Script</samp>.</p>
