<h3 id="inserting-date">Inserting the Date</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You're typing a document and want to insert the current date.</p>

<p>For example, you're composing a letter and want to include today's date at
the top.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use <tt>!!date</tt> in Normal mode.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The <tt>!!<var>command</var></tt> syntax executes <var>command</var> and
replaces the current line with the output.<span class="fn">This is
  in fact an oversimplification. <tt><var>count</var>!!<var>command</var></tt>
  actually filters <var>count</var> lines through <var>command</var> and
  returns the result, but when <var>count</var> is omitted, it has the effect
  I've described. This is why the text on the current line is
  <em>replaced</em> with the date.</span>. To control where the date is
inserted see the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>A similar same effect can be achieved with <tt>:r!date</tt>. The advantage
is that it inserts the output of <tt>date</tt> on the next line, rather than
replacing the current one.</p>

<p>The solutions above assume that you have a <tt>date</tt> executable in your
<tt>PATH</tt>, as all UNIX-based systems should. I understand that Windows
users have to use <tt>!!date /t</tt>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can call Vim's <tt>strftime()</tt> function, e.g.
<tt>strftime("%c")</tt>. This will work on all systems which support the
<tt>strftime</tt> system call, which I believe is the majority. You can <a
  href="#creating-keyboard-shortcuts-with-key-mappings">map</a> this function
to a function key. For example, the following commands map
<kbd>&lt;F7&gt;</kbd> to insert a date stamp after the cursor.</p>

<pre><code>:inoremap &lt;F7&gt; &lt;C-R&gt;=strftime("%c")&lt;CR&gt;
:nnoremap &lt;F7&gt; "=strftime("%c")&lt;CR&gt;p</code></pre>

<p>I suggest the use of <tt>!!date</tt> because it doesn't waste a function
key, and, personally, I find it more memorable. If you intend to insert dates
regularly, by all means remap a key to do so.</p>
