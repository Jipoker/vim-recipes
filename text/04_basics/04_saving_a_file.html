<h3 id="saving-a-file">Saving a File</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to save the file you've been working on.</p>

<p>After you've made changes to a file you typically want to save them.  For
example, if you've written up a turkey recipe to send to your daughter, you'd
open Vim, type the recipe, save it to <tt>turkey-recipe.txt</tt>, then e-mail
<tt>turkey-recipe.txt</tt> to your hungry child.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>In Vim parlance, saving is 'writing', so to save your changes to the
current file use <tt>:w[rite]</tt>. If your file doesn't have a name yet,
you'll need to follow <tt>:w</tt> with a filename. This is conceptually
similar to most word processors' <em>Save</em> function.</p>

<p>To change the name of an existing file, use <tt>:saveas
  <var>file</var></tt>. If <var>file</var> already exists and you want to
overwrite it, use <code>:saveas! <var>file</var></code>. This is conceptually
the same as most word processors' <em>Save As</em> function.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>There are a number of situations where it can be useful to have Vim save
your file for you automatically. One is when you're working with files in <a
  href="#navigating-buffers">multiple buffers</a> and cycling between them. By
default, every time you switch to a buffer Vim prompts you to save the current
one first. Another is when you execute an external command on the current
file. The command is passed the file's name, so if your buffer contains
unsaved changes, the command won't see them. The solution is to <tt>:set
  autowrite</tt>. This causes files to be automatically saved when you switch
buffers and execute external commands. If you also want files automatically
saved when you quit Vim, use <tt>:set autowriteall</tt>.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>The <code>:autowrite</code> functionality is not related to some word
  processor's concept of auto-saving a file periodically in case of a crash.
  Vim does this automatically.</p>  
</blockquote>

<p>You can also "write" a specific portion of a file to a new filename. By
prefixing the <tt>:write</tt> command with a line range only the specified
lines are written to the named file. For example, <tt>:20,30w 20-30.txt</tt>
saves lines twenty to thirty of the current buffer to a file named
<tt>20-30.txt</tt>. Alternatively, select a portion of a file <a
  href="#visually-selecting-text">visually</a> then execute <tt>:w
  <var>filename</var></tt> and the text you selected will be written to a file
named <tt>filename</tt>.
