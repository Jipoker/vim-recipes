<h3 id="changing-window-title">Changing the Window Title</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to change the title of a Vim window to make it more
descriptive.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Assign a value to the <tt>titlestring</tt> option, and set the
<tt>title</tt> option. For example:</p>

<pre><code>:set title titlestring=My\ Title</code></pre>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>When working with multiple instances of Vim, it can be difficult to
remember what task each window corresponds to. You can avoid this problem by
customising each window's title. The window title can also function similarly
to the <a href="#changing-status-line">status line</a>, reminding the user
about an important aspect of the current file.</p>

<p>The default window title contains the current filename, followed by a
character indicating the state of this file, followed by the name of its
directory<span class="fn">To be precise, the directory name is followed by a
  hyphen then the value of <tt>&amp;v:servername</tt>, if set, otherwise
  just <i>VIM</i>.</span>. The state character is one of the following:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>-</tt></dt><dd>File can't be modified</dd>
  <dt><tt>+</tt></dt><dd>File has been modified</dd>
  <dt><tt>=</tt></dt><dd>File is read-only</dd>
  <dt><tt>=+</tt></dt><dd>File is read-only and has been modified</dd>
</dl>  

<p>This is already quite a descriptive title, but we can customise it further
using a format string, as described in the <a
  href="#changing-status-line">Changing the Status Line</a> recipe. The Vim
documentation (<tt>:help titlestring</tt>) gives the following example:</p>

<pre><code>:auto BufEnter * let &amp;titlestring = hostname() . "/" .
expand("%:p")</code></pre>

<p>Here the window title is reset when the user enters a new buffer. It
contains the hostname, a forward slash, then the full path of the current
file<span class="fn">For an explanation of the <tt>%:p</tt> syntax see the <a
    href="#filename-modifers">Filename Modifiers</a> section of the <a
    href="#executing-external-commands">Executing External Commands</a>
  recipe.</span>.</p>

<p>Another example is to display the value of an environment variable in the
window title along with the filename. For instance, Ruby on Rails developers
could prefix the filename with the value of <tt>RAILS_ENV</tt>, which
indicates whether the application is in development, production, staging, or
testing mode:</p>

<pre><code>let &amp;titlestring=expand($RAILS_ENV) . ": " .
expand("%:t")</code></pre>

<p>One last trick is to embed the value of an external command in the window
title using the <tt>%{system('<var>command</var>')}</tt> syntax. This could be
used to display the name of the current branch, if using a version control
system, or indicate whether the project's unit tests are passing or
failing.</p>
