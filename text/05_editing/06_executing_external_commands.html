<h3 id="executing-external-commands">Executing External Commands</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to run a program from within Vim, possibly having it operate on the
current file.</p>

<p>For example, you want to view a list of the other files in your project by
getting a listing of the current directory. Or you want to find the word count
of the essay you're working on by passing its filename to the <tt>wc</tt>
utility.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Invoke the program using the <tt>:!<var>program</var></tt> syntax. For
example, to view a directory listing on a POSIX system: <tt>:!ls</tt>.</p>

<p>If you need to pass the current filename to the command as an argument, use
the <tt>%</tt> wildcard. For example, executing <tt>:!wc %</tt> from
<tt>aristotle-essay.txt</tt> executes <tt>wc aristotle-essay.txt</tt>.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">

<h5 id="filename-modifers">Filename Modifiers</h5>

<p>You can alter the filename represented by <tt>%</tt> by following the wildcard
with a modifier. For example:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>%:p</tt></dt>
  <dd>Makes the filename a full path.</dd>
  <dt><tt>%:.</tt></dt>
  <dd>Makes the filename relative to the current directory.</dd>
  <dt><tt>%:t</tt></dt>
  <dd>Removes any directories before the actual file name. For
  example <tt>~/work/foo.txt</tt> &#8658; <tt>foo.txt</tt>.</dd>
  <dt><tt>%:e</tt></dt>
  <dd>Removes everything except the filename extension. For
  example <tt>~/work/foo.txt</tt> &#8658; <tt>txt</tt>.</dd>
</dl>

</blockquote>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The concept is that Vim suspends itself, asks your system to execute the
command, shows you its output, then, once the user presses
<kbd>&lt;Enter&gt;</kbd>, returns you to Vim.</p>

<p>If you don't want to see the output of the command, you can execute it like
this: <tt>:silent <var>command</var></tt>. (To also hide any error output:
<tt>:silent! <var>command</var></tt>).</p>

<p>You can use <tt>:redir &gt; <var>file</var></tt> if you want to save the
output of a command to a file. You first execute, say, <tt>:redir &gt;
  /tmp/output</tt>, then <tt>:!<var>command</var></tt>. The output for
<var>command</var> will be saved in the file <tt>/tmp/output</tt>, and
displayed on the screen. (You can combine <tt>:silent <var>command</var></tt>
and <tt>:redir <var>file</var></tt> to redirect a command's output to a file
without seeing it on screen). To stop output redirection execute <tt>:redir
  END</tt>. </p>

<p>You can use <tt>:r!<var>command</var></tt> to execute <var>command</var>
and read in its output to the current file. For example, if you're using a
POSIX system, you can insert your kernel version with <tt>:r!uname
  -v</tt>.</p>
