<h3 id="selecting-text-with-motions">Selecting Text with Motions</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to define an area of text for a command to operate on without
leaving <i>Normal</i> mode.</p>

<p>For example, you want to delete next two words, or reformat the current
paragraph.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>In <i>Normal</i> and <i>Visual</i> mode operator commands can be followed
by <i>motions</i> which describe what text they should operate on. They can be
thought of as a set of directions the operator should use to select text.</p>

<p>For example, you can delete the character under the cursor with
<kbd>d</kbd>.  If you wanted to delete the word <i>fandangle</i> you'd need to
press <kbd>d</kbd> nine times: once for each character. You could simply the
process by prefixing <kbd>d</kbd> with a <a
  href="#repeating-commands"><i>count</i></a>: <kbd>9d</kbd>. However, that
requires you to know how many characters are in the word, and would be totally
impractical if you wanted to delete multiple words at once. The motion for a
word is <tt>w</tt>, so you can delete the word more easily with
<kbd>dw</kbd>.</p>

<p>The following table shows some common operators which understand motions.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>    
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>                     
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>c</kbd></td>
    <td>change</td>
    <td>Deletes then enters insert mode.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>d</kbd></td>
    <td>delete</td>
    <td><a href="#deleting-text">Deletes</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>y</kbd></td>
    <td>yank</td>
    <td><a href="#copying-cutting-pasting">Copies</a> to a register.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>gq</kbd></td>
    <td>format</td>
    <td>Reformats.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>&gt;</kbd></td>
    <td>indent</td>
    <td><a href="#indenting-lines">Shifts text left</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>&lt;</kbd></td>
    <td>unindent</td>
    <td><a href="#indenting-lines">Shifts text right</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Here are some common motions:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Moves</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>h</kbd></td>
    <td>Right <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>l</kbd></td>
    <td>Left <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>j</kbd></td>
    <td>Down <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>k</kbd></td>
    <td>Up <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>$</kbd></td>
    <td>To end of the line <var>count</var>-1 lines downward.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>0</kbd></td>
    <td>To the first character of the line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>f<var>char</var></kbd></td>
    <td>To the <var>count</var><sup>th</sup> occurrence of <var>char</var> to the right.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We can combine operators and motions to select text then operate upon it.
Let's look at some examples:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><kbd>y10h</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Copy the next 10 characters to a register.</dd>
  <dt><kbd>d$</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Delete from the current character until the end of the line.</dd>
  <dt><kbd>c2j</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Delete the current line and the one below it, then enter insert mode.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Motions aren't very intelligent. Say you wanted to delete the word
<i>This</i> with <kbd>dw</kbd>. That works as long as your cursor is over
<i>T</i>; if you were on the <i>h</i>, you'd only delete that.</p>

<p>Vim supports additional motions for operating on text objects.  One of
these is <kbd>aw</kbd> (mnemonic: <em>a</em> <em>w</em>ord) which would do the
right thing in both examples above because it considers what <em>object</em>,
not character, the cursor over.</p>

<p><i>Text object</i> commands are very similar to motions, and can be used
with the same operators. They're frequently just a motion command prefixed
with either <i>a</i> or <i>i</i>. The <i>a</i> prefix indicates that the whole
object will be selected, including white space; the <i>i</i> prefix selects
the <i>inner</i> object without white space, or just the white space. A few of
the available commands follow:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Selects</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>aw</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> words</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>iw</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>as</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> sentences</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>is</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>aB</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> [&#x2026;] or {&#x2026;} blocks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>iB</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>a"</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> quoted strings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>i"</kbd></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So, to delete a paragraph, position your cursor anywhere inside it then hit
<kbd>dap</kbd>. <em>D</em>elete <em>a</em> <em>p</em>aragraph - it even sounds
sensible<span class="fn">No, this is not a bug.</span>.</p>
