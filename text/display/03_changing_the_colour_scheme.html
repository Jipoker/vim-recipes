<h3 id="changing-colour-scheme">Chaging the Colour Scheme</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You don't like the colours Vim uses; you want to change them.</p>

<p>For example, you've found a colour scheme you like better, so want to
instruct Vim to use it. Or, you find that the current colour scheme makes text
hard to read so want to find a more suitable one.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To browse existing colour schemes enter <tt>:colourscheme</tt>, then hit
<kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> to cycle through the installed schemes. If you find one
that you like hit <kbd>&lt;Enter&gt;</kbd> to apply it.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>A colour scheme is a set of rules controlling how different elements of the
interface appear. Vim is distributed with a selection of colour schemes, but
you can also download new ones, as explained in the sidebar.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>The <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maverick/VimColorSchemeTest/">Vim
    Color Scheme Test</a> is a a gallery of colour schemes along with their
  names. Browse through it to select a theme you like, then follow the
  instructions below to install it.</p>

  <h5>Installing Colour Schemes</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>Browse the available colour schemes at <a
      href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?script_type=color+scheme">Vim.org</a>
    and download any that you like.</li>
    <li>Create a <tt>$VIM/colors</tt>, e.g. <tt>mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors</tt> on
    POSIX systems.</li>
    <li>Copy the <tt>.vim</tt> file you downloaded in step one to the
    <tt>colors</tt> directory you just created.</li>
    <li>Open <tt>vim</tt> then execute <tt>:colorscheme <var>name</var></tt>,
    where <var>name</var> is that of the file you downloaded without the
    <tt>.vim</tt> extension.</li>
    <li>If you want to use this colour scheme permanently add <tt>colorscheme
      <var>name</var></tt> to your <a
      href="#configuring-vim"><tt>vimrc</tt></a>; otherwise repeat these steps
    with a different colour scheme.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Before you change your color scheme you may like to make a note of what
you're using at the moment. You can find the name of the current scheme with
<tt>:echo
  g:colors_name</tt>.</p>
