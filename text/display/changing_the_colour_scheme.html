<h3>Chaging the Colour Scheme</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You don't like the colours Vim uses; you want to change them.</p>

<p>For example, you've found a colour scheme you like better, so want to instruct
Vim to use it. Or, you find that the current colour scheme makes text hard to
read so want to find a better one.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To change to a new colour scheme execute <kbd>:colorscheme <var>name</var></kbd>.</p>

<p>To browse existing colour schemes enter <kbd>:colourscheme</kbd>, then hit
<kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> to cycle through the installed schemes. If you find one that you like hit
<kbd>&lt;Enter&gt;</kbd> to apply it.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>A colour scheme is a set of rules controlling how different elements of the
interface appear. Vim is distributed with a selection of colour schemes, but
you can also download new ones <span class="todo">link recipe</span>, or create your own
<span class="todo">link recipe</span>.</p>

<p><span class="todo">some screenshots illustrating different colour schemes along with their
names</span></p>

<p>Before you change your color scheme you may like to make a note of what you're
using at the moment. You can find the name of the current scheme with <kbd>:echo
  g:colors_name</kbd>.</p>

<p>To change a specific aspect of a colour scheme you can redefine a highlight
group <span class="footnote">Recipe: sec:re-highlight</span>.</p>
