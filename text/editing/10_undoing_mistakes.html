<h3 id="undoing-mistakes">Undoing Mistakes</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You've made a mistake while editing and you'd like to revert it.  Or,
worse, you've made a mistake while reverting a mistake, and you'd like to
revert that.</p>

<p>For example, you've just deleted the paragraphs containing, subject to peer
review, the cure for cancer. You'd kinda' like to retrieve it, and pretend the
whole situation had never occurred.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use the <i>undo</i> feature. Hit <kbd>u</kbd> in <i>Normal</i> mode or <tt>:u</tt> in
<i>Command</i> mode. You can undo all recent changes on the current line with
<kbd>U</kbd>. To undo multiple times either repeat the command or prefix it with
a digit indicating the number of times. For example, to undo the previous
change and the one before that: <kbd>uu</kbd>.</p>

<p>To redo a change that was undone use
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></kbd> or <tt>:redo</tt>.</p>

<p>You can also jump backwards and forwards through your edits by time. To
return to how your file looked 1 hour ago use <tt>:earlier 1h</tt>, then
travel forward 20 minutes with <tt>:later 20m</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The undo/redo behaviour described above should be familiar to most users as
it mirrors that of many other applications. Vim, however, extends this concept
into the idea of <i>undo branches</i>.</p>

<p>Imagine you opened a new file and entered <i>elephant</i>. You then entered
<i>calf</i> on a new line and hit <kbd>u</kbd>. This undid the addition of
<i>calf</i> so now your file just contains the word <i>elephant</i>. Next you
entered <i>moose</i>. If you hit <kbd>u</kbd> again you'd undo <i>moose</i>
and get back to <i>elephant</i>.  No matter how many times you do this you'd
never get the <i>calf</i> back (which is unacceptable; elephant calves are
particularly photogenic) because you made an edit after undoing (by adding
<i>moose</i>).</p>

<p>Undo branches to the rescue. Hit <kbd>g-</kbd> and your file will now
contain <i>elephant</i> then <i>calf</i>. Here are the events represented
diagramatically:</p>

<p><img src="undo-branches.png"/></p>

<p>Vim implicitly created an undo branch each time you hit <kbd>u</kbd>. The
branch represents the state of the file before you undid. <kbd>g-</kbd> (and
<kbd>g+</kbd> to move forwards) moves between these branches. </p>
