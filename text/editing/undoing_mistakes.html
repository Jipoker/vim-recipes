<h3>Undoing Mistakes</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You've made a mistake while editing and you'd like to revert it.  Or, worse,
you've made a mistake while reverting a mistake, and you'd like to revert
that.</p>

<p>For example, you've just deleted the paragraphs containing, subject to peer
review, the cure for cancer. You'd kinda' like to retrieve it, and pretend the
whole situation had never occurred.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use the 'undo' feature'. Hit <tt>u</tt> in Normal mode or <tt>:u</tt> in
Command mode. You can undo all recent changes on the current line with
<tt>U</tt>. To undo multiple times either repeat the command or prefix it with
a digit indicating the number of times. For example, to undo the previous
change and the one before that: <tt>uu</tt>.</p>

<p><span class="todo">Sidebar: "In the Vim way, "uu" undoes two changes.  In
the Vi-compatible way, "uu" does nothing (undoes an undo)."</span></p>

<p>To redo a change that was undone use <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;+R</tt> or <tt>:redo</tt>.</p>

<p>You can also jump backwards and forwards through your edits by time. To return
to how your file looked 1 hour ago use <tt>:earlier 1h</tt>, then travel
forward 20 minutes with <tt>:later 20m</tt>. <span class="todo">Footnote

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The undo/redo behaviour described above should be familiar to most users as it
mirrors that of many other applications. Vim, however, extends this concept
into the idea of 'undo branches'.</p>

<p>Imagine you opened a new file and entered 'elephant'. You then entered 'calf'
on a new line and hit <tt>u</tt>. <span class="todo">Pendant: If you did this
fast they'd both be grouped as the same change; how to make this
clearer</span> This undid the addition of 'calf' so now your file just
contains the word 'elephant'. Next you entered 'moose'. If you hit <tt>u</tt>
again you'd undo 'moose' and get back to 'elephant'.  No matter how many times
you do this you'd never get the 'calf' back (which is unacceptable; elephant
calves are particularly photogenic) because you made an edit after undoing (by
adding 'moose'). </p>

<p><span class="todo">Image of elephant calf</span></p>

<p>Undo branches to the rescue. Hit <tt>g-</tt> and your file will now contain
'elephant' then 'calf'. Here are the events represented diagramatically:</p>

<p><img src="undo-branches.png"/></p>

<p>Vim implicitly created an undo branch each time you hit <tt>u</tt>. The branch
represents the state of the file before you undid. <tt>g-</tt> (and <tt>g+</tt> to move
forwards) moves between these branches. </p>
