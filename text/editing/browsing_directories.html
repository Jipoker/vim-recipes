<h3>Browsing Directories</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to see the contents of a directory, perhaps so as to select a file
to edit. For instance, if working on a project comprising multiple files you
want to see a list of the files in a seperate window.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p><span class="todo">Explain that this also works with SSH/FTP; link Opening
Remote Files</span></p>

<p>Invoke Vim with a directory name as an argument, e.g. <code>vim
~/projects/flying-pigs/</code>. From within Vim use the <code>:Ex</code>
(mnemonic: <i>Ex</i>plore) command. By default it shows the contents of the
current file's directory, but you can provide a directory name if you wish.
For example: <code>:Ex ~/projects/flying-pigs</code>. The directory is shown
in a split screen if the current file has been modified.</p>

<p>To force a directory listing in a split pane, so you can view a file and
its directory listing at once, use <code>:Sex</code><span class="fn">No,
that's not a joke; the concept is synonmous with Vim</span>. Similarly,
<code>:Vex</code> to browse in a vertical split, and <code>:Tex</code> to
browse in a new tab.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p><span class="todo">Explain how to view recursive directory listings</span></p>

<p>By default Vim lists every file contained in a directory. To get a more
<code>ls</code>-style listing you can specify a hiding list with <code>:let
g:netrw_listhide='\^\..*'</code><span class="todo">Typeset that regex
correctly. Is this only on Linux?</span>. (This is a comma-seperated list of
regular expressions).  When you're browsing a directory files starting with a
period will now be hidden. <span class="fn">By Unix/Linux convention filenames
which begin with a period are designated hidden. By default file browsers and
other utilities ignore these files unless explicitly commanded not to. <span
class="todo">How does this work on Windows?</span></span> If you hit
<kbd>a</kbd> once you'll invert the hiding list (showing only hidden files).
If you hit <kbd>a</kbd> again you'll remove the hiding list, showing
everything.</p>

<p>To change how directory entries are sorted you can modify the
<code>g:netrw_sort_sequence</code> variable. By default its value is
<code>[\/]\$,.h\$,.c\$,.cpp\$,.[a-np-z]\$,*,.info\$,.swp\$,.o\$,.obj\$,.bak\$</code>.
The order of the patterns is the order of the sort. For instance, the first
pattern matches directories, so they're shown first. The next pattern matches
file names ending with '*.h' (C header files), so they're shown next. And so
on. The '*' pattern matches everything not matched by the other patterns. You
can change this pattern on-the-fly by hitting <kbd>S</kbd> while viewing a
directory listing.</p>

<p>You can change into a directory by selecting it and hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd>. The same thing works for files. If you'd rather open a file
in a new buffer use <kbd>p</kbd>. <kbd>P</kbd> will open the file in a split
screen.</p>

Manager. <span class="todo">link recipe</span></p>
