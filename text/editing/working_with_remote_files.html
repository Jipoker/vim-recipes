<h3>Working with Remote Files</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to edit/view a file that is stored on another computer.</p>

<p>For example, you might want to change a file on your website
from your home computer. Or, you want to change the 'message of
the day' file on a server you administer.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To invoke Vim with a remote file use its URL as the argument to <tt>vim</tt>.
For example: <tt>vim sftp://guest@example.com/file.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>To work with remote files from within Vim, just use their URLs in place of a
filename with normal editing commands.</p>

<p>So, to to open a remote file for editing use \texttt{:e {URL}}. For example:
<tt>:e ftp://user@example.com/README</tt>.</p>

<p>To save to a remote file use \texttt{:w {URL}}. For example: <tt>:w
scp://kci@jojo.example.com/etc/motd</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>If you need to make a quick change to a remote file Vim's native support for
editing URLs is invaluable. <span class="todo">Is this just fluff?</span></p>

<p>Vim supports the following protocols: 'SCP', 'SFTP', 'RCP', 'HTTP'
(read-only), 'DAV', 'rsync' (read-only), and 'fetch' (read-only). However, it
relies on external programs to do so.  On Linux, most of these programs are
available by default; on Windows, for example, only 'FTP' is normally
available. <span class="todo">Is this still true? Macs?</span> See <tt>:help
netrw-externapp</tt> for more information.</p>

<p>If the protocol requires authentication, you can supply the username as part
of the URL, and then be prompted for the password interactively. This gets
boring fast, however. </p>

<p>If you're editing files via SSH or SCP consider setting up "passwordless
logins". <span class="todo">Explain this. Sidebar explanation?  Ref:
netrw-ssh-hack</span></p>

<p>If you're using FTP on Linux, you can store your credentials in
<tt>~/.netrc'</tt>.  <span class="todo">sidebar on dangers of FTP?</span>
<span class="todo">Sidebar this explanation</span> The file is formatted as
follows:</p>

<pre><code> machine {host name 1}
         login {username}
         password {password}

 machine {host name 2}
...
</code></pre>

<p>It should be made read-only for your user: <tt>chmod 600 ~/.netrc</tt>
<span class="todo">Windows explanation?</span>.  Now you can use URLs like
<i>ftp://example.org/README</i>, and it will find your username and password
automatically.</p>
