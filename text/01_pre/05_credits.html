  <h4>Cover Image</h4>

  <p>The cover photograph of <a href="http://moolenaar.net/">Bram Moolenaar</a>,
  the creator of Vim, was taken by <a
    href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</a> and kindly
  released under a <a
    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons
    Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License</a>. The original photograph can

  <h4>CSS</h4>

  <p>The Cascading Style Sheets used in the production of the book were derived
  significantly from the work of others. <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark
    Pilgrim</a>'s stylesheet from <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/"><i>Dive
      Into Python 3</i></a> was the main inspiration. In conjunction, the CSS
  created by <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">Håkon Wium Lie</a> and
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/">Bert Bos</a> for their book entitled
  <a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0321193121"><i>Cascading Style
      Sheets: Designing for the Web, 3rd Edition</i></a>, and graciously made
  available via <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/boom">A List
    Apart</a>, was particularly helpful. Lastly, <a
    href="http://simplesideias.com.br/">Nando Vieira</a>'s <a
    href="http://github.com/fnando/kitabu/tree/master">kitabu</a> project
  offered ideas on how to tie it all together.</p>
