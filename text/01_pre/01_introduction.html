<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Vim text editor is perhaps as famous for its learning curve as it is
for its contributions to productivity. Vim isn't "intuitive" in the way other
applications claim to be -- you cannot use it by simply replicating the
actions you perform with a word processor, by clicking on menu items aimlessly
until you achieve your desired effect. But this is by design. The major
strength of Vim is that it does things differently <i>to magnificent
  effect</i>. It permanently alters the way in which you regard text editors
and software in general. And that is why, in 2009, I am putting the finishing
touches to a free book about a text editor whose ancestry can be traced back
to 1976.</p>

<p>This book is written to be consulted when you're looking for a better way to
perform a task. It does not replace Vim's excellent built-in documentation,
but complements it by focussing on tasks rather than commands. It will always
be incomplete by virtue of Vim having more features and extensions than I have
years alive, but will hopefully still serve as an indispensable reference.</p>

<p>In addition to being free, this book is open source. The files from which
it is compiled are freely available, for you to examine and, hopefully,
improve. In any case, I would enjoy hearing any feedback you have. Contact
details are in the <i>Contributing</i> section, and you can e-mail me at the
address below.</p>

<p>Happy Viming!</p>
