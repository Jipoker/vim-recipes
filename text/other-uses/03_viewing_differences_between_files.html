<h3 id="viewing-differences-between-files">Viewing Differences Between Files</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You have multiple versions of a file and want to see how they differ.</p>

<p>For example, if you're working on a document with somebody else, you want
to see the differences between their version and yours.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Vim calls this feature <i>diff</i>, as per UNIX convention. You <i>diff</i>
a file.</p>

<p>To diff from the command line invoke Vim as <tt>vimdiff</tt>, e.g.
<tt>vimdiff -o <var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></tt>. To diff from within Vim
use <tt>:diffsplit <var>file</var></tt>.</p>

<p>The screen is split horizontally, and each file is shown in its own window.
The differences between them are highlighted. Lines that exist in one buffer
but not in By default, a line that exists in one file but not in another is
coloured blue; the line in the other buffer that should have held this line is
coloured green, and is called a 'filler' line. When a line exists in both
buffers it is coloured purple. If characters inside the line differ they are
highlighted in red. Identical lines have no highlighting.  Identical runs of
lines are <a href="#navigating-folds">folded</a>.</p>

<p>To split the screen vertically use <tt>vimdif <var>file1</var>
  <var>file2</var></tt> or <tt>:vert diffsplit <var>file1</var>
  <var>file2</var></tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Diffs are traditionally used in programming to compare an old and new
version of source code to see what has changed. As suggested above, though,
they're invaluable when collaborating on a file with somebody else. For
example, you write a file named <tt>grant-proposal.txt</tt>, then e-mail it to
somebody else for input. They make their changes and e-mail it back. You now
have two files: <tt>grant-proposal.txt</tt> and
<tt>grant-proposal.changes.txt</tt>.  You use <tt>vimdiff grant-proposal.txt
  grant-proposal.changes.txt</tt> to see your collaborator's suggestions.</p>

<p>It's important to note, though, that diff only works with plain text files.
It won't work correctly if you use proprietary, binary formats such as
Microsoft Word's <tt>.doc</tt>. As a general rule, if Vim can view a file it
can diff it.</p>

<p>The windows <i>diff</i> feature splits your screen so each pane scrolls in
concert with one other. This means that if you scroll to line 20 in the bottom
pane, the top pane will automatically scroll to that point, too. This makes
comparing long files easier, but you can disable it with <tt>:set
  noscrollbind</tt>.</p>

<p>You can jump between the changes with <kbd>[c</kbd> to go to the previous
change, and <kbd>]c</kbd> for the next.</p>
