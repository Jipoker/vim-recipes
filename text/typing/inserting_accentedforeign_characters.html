<h3 id="inserting-accented-characters">Inserting Accented or "Foreign" Characters</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to type characters which don't exist on your keyboard.</p>

<p>For example, you want to type some words in another language, so need to
insert accented characters. Or you want to type a symbol such as &plusmn;.
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>If you haven't already, set up Vim to use UTF-8 by following the sidebar.
It makes this process far easier.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">
  
  <h5>Enabling UTF-8 Support</h5>

  <p>Vim uses the encoding specified by the user's environment. On Linux this
  is set with the <tt>$LANG</tt> variable. To override this use <tt>:set
    encoding=utf-8</tt>.</p>

  <p>If you're using Vim from a terminal your terminal software must also be
  configured to use UTF-8. Instructions for that are outside the scope of this
  recipe.</p>

  <p>When editing files their current encoding is maintained, so if you opened
  a file in <i>ISO-8859-2</i>, your changes would be written in that encoding.
  To force UTF-8 for all files use <tt>:set encoding=utf-8
    fileencodings=</tt>.</p>

</blockquote>  

<p>To insert an accented character you press
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>, the unadorned character, then
another character indicating the accent type.  This method can also be used to
produce translations of characters in a given script.</p>

<p>For example, to insert an e acute (the last letter in <i>café</i>) you hold
down <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>, type <i>e</i>, then type
an apostrophe (<i>'</i>). </p>

<p>The following table shows the different types of characters you can produce:</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>This method of input is most suitable for occasionally typing unusual
characters. For regular use, Vim supports most input methods. See <tt>:help
  keymap</tt> and <tt>:help termencoding</tt> for more details.</p>

<p>Vim refers to printable, non-ASCII characters as <i>digraphs</i>. A list of
digraphs available on your system can be obtained with the command
<tt>:digraphs</tt>. The output may appear chaotic, but that's mainly because
it's so dense. It lists, in columns, the character's internal name, the
literal character, and the character code in decimal.</p>

<p>You can also insert characters using their character code. If you're one of
the slackers who haven't memorised the Unicode specification yet, you can use
the <tt>:digraphs</tt> command, or any other reference, to lookup the code.
Hit <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd></kbd>, then type the code in
either hexadecimal or decimal.  Continuing the above example of producing
<i>é</i>, you could enter either <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd>
  <kbd>xe9</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd>
  <kbd>233</kbd></kbd>. </p>

<p>The internal name <tt>:digraphs</tt> lists corresponds with the shortcut
table above.  That is to say, the internal name for <i>é</i> is <i>e'</i>.
Thus, we can generalise the <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd></kbd>
approach for any character we know the name of. For example, to produce the
<i>&plusmn;</i> sign you hit
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>-<kbd>+-</kbd></kbd>. </p>
