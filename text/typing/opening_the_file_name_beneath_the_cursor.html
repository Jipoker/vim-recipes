<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You have a file name under your cursor and would like Vim to open it.</p>

<p>For example, program source code often references other files from which it
includes functionality. You want to quickly open such a file.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Position your cursor over a file name then hit <kbd>gf</kbd> (mnemonic:
<i>g</i>o to <i>f</i>ile or <i>g</i>et <i>f</i>ile) in <i>Normal</i> mode.  For
example, consider a file like the following:</p>

<pre>
Edit your <tt>~/.vimrc</tt> by opening it with Vim, then...
</pre>

<p>If your cursor was anywhere over <tt>~/.vimrc</tt>, <kbd>gf</kbd> would try to
open your Vim configuration file. (This assumes that you're using Linux where
<tt>~</tt> is shorthand for the user's home directory).</p>

<p>Vim doesn't care if the word under the cursor looks like a filename,
so if your cursor was over the word <i>your</i>, instead, it would try to open a
file named <tt>your</tt> in your path.</p>

<p>Your <i>path</i> is a list of directories in which Vim searches for the named
file.  To see what it's currently set to execute <tt>:echo &amp;path</tt>. The
path is a comma-separated list of directories, some of which have special
significance:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><i>.</i></dt>
  <dd>The directory containing the current file.</dd>
  <dt><i>;</i></dt>
  <dd>A path that ends with a semicolon is searched recursively,
  up the directory hierarchy. For example <tt>/usr/share/doc;</tt> means
  to first search in <tt>/usr/share/doc</tt>, then <tt>/usr/share/</tt>, then
  <tt>/usr/</tt>, then <tt>/</tt>.</dd>
  <dt><i>*</i></dt>
  <dd>A path that ends in an asterisk is searched
  recursively downwards. For example, <tt>/home/kate/*</tt> would
  search all of user <i>kate</i>'s home directory.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I like <tt>gf</tt> to search recursively downwards from the current directory
so I append <tt>./*</tt> to my path like so: <tt>:set path+=./*</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>This feature has a surprising amount of uses for something so
basic. I use it when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Log files are referenced in e-mail alerts.</li>
  <li>To open files referenced in my version control system's commit e-mails. 
  <span class="todo">TODO: link recipe: Vim with VCS, Vim for
  Email</span></li>
  <li>When outlining<span class="fn">The <i>Indentation Folding</i> sidebar in
    <a href="#manually-creating-folds">Manually Creating Folds</a> describes
    one approach to outlining in Vim</span> a project that consists of
  multiple files. Each level of outline links to the relevant file.</li>
  <li>To view source code for external modules when writing
  source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vim also lets you follow URLs in this way<span
  class="fn"><a href="#opening-remote-files">Opening Remote Files</a> explains how to use Vim with remote
files</span>, so you can <tt>gf</tt> on <tt>http://example.com/</tt>, to open
the HTML in Vim, or <tt>sftp://example.com/README</tt> to connect to
<i>example.com</i> via SFTP, fetch <tt>README</tt>, then open it for editing
in Vim.</p>

<p>By default <tt>gf</tt> opens the file in the same window. To open it in a
new window (by <a href="#splitting-the-screen">splitting the screen</a> use
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>wf</kbd></kbd>. To make this behaviour the
default consider a <a href="#creating-keyboard-shortcuts">key remap</a>:
<tt>:nnoremap gf &lt;C-W&gt;gf</tt>.</p>

<p>If your filename is followed by a line number, e.g.  <i>foo.txt:10</i> you
can jump to the given line with <kbd>gF</kbd>.</p>

<p>If the filename you use <kbd>gf</kbd> on doesn't exist, Vim complains. I
don't use <kbd>gF</kbd> so I have remapped it to create the given file:
<tt>:nnoremap gF :view &lt;cfile&gt;&lt;cr&gt;</tt>.</p>
