<h3 id="navigating-buffers">Navigating Buffers</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You have multiple files open and want to navigate between them.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Buffers allow you to have a collection of files open with only one
displayed at a time. They are particularly useful for processing a set of
files sequentially, whereby you operate on one file, then switch to the buffer
containing the next. If you'd rather have the open files listed along the top
of the screen, consider using <a href="#navigating-tabs"><i>tabs</i></a>
instead.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>To quickly navigate between buffers its common to map <tt>:bnext</tt> and/or
<tt>:bprev</tt> to a key. For example <tt>map &lt;F6&gt; :bn&lt;CR&gt;</tt> lets you hit
<kbd>&lt;F6&gt;</kbd> to cycle through the open buffers.</p>
