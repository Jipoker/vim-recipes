<h3>Manually Creating Folds</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to <i>fold</i> a file, then navigate it in <i>outline</i> mode.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<div class="callout">

  <h5>Enabling Folding</h5>

  Folding is very likely already enabled in your Vim. If not,
  check it has been compiled with <span class="todo">Section on viewing
  compile-time options?</span> the <i>+folding</i> option,
  and that <tt>foldenable</tt> is true, i.e. <tt>:set foldenable</tt>.

</div>

<p>Use Vim's <i>folding</i> feature to treat a file hierarchically,
expanding and collapsing its sections as necessary. <span class="todo">Add
screenshots</span></p>

<p>Fold commands start with <i>z</i>. Vim's help makes the spurious case
that this, kinda', if you squint, looks like a <i>fold</i>ed piece of
paper.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Command</th> <th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>zf</tt></td> <td>Fold the selected text.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>zf#j</tt></td> <td>Create a fold from the cursor down <i>#</i>
  lines.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>zf/string</tt></td> <td>Create a fold from the cursor to
  <i>string</i>.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zfaB</tt></td>
    <td>Fold the current block delimited by bracket <var>B</var><span
    class="fn"><var>B</var> can be any of <tt>()[]{}&lt;&gt;</tt>. This feature 
    understands nested blocks, too, so will usually do 
    the right thing.</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="todo">Associate zfaB with the text-object recipe</span></p>

<p>For instance, <tt>zf4j</tt> creates a fold from the current line to the forth
line down. Or, if you've selected text in Visual mode <span class="todo">link
to recipe</span>, then <tt>zf</tt> will fold the selection.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>How you use folds will depend very much on the type of file you are editing.
They are particularly useful for long papers or essays, for instance, where
you fold each section so as to navigate the document hierarchically. When
editing program source code they can be used with function/method/class
declarations.</p>

<p>This recipe is entitled <i>Manually</i> Creating Folds, because there are other
approaches to folding which are automatic. <span class="todo">Link to examples; expand
explanation</span>. </p>

<p><span class="todo">Should this be sidebar'd or another recipe?</span></p>

<div class="callout">

  <h5>Indentation Folding</h5>

  If you're working with structured, indented text you may prefer to use
  indentation folding. 

  Enable it with <tt>:set foldmethod=indent</tt>. Folds are now automatically
  created for each level of indented text. (To indent simply start a line with a
  tab\footnote{Each <i>shiftwidth</i> of indent corresponds to one fold. See
  Recipe~\ref{sec:indenting} for more on indentation.}). So, for example,
  <tt>zM</tt> folds all indented text. <span class="todo">Explain better; note
  that this precludes usage of all other indent methods</span>. 

</div>

<p><span class="todo">Firstly, this isn't the next recipe. Secondly, should we write it?</span></p>

<p>To expand, collapse, and otherwise navigate folds see the next recipe:
