<h3>Navigating Source Code</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You're editing the source code for a computer program, and want to navigate it
efficiently.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p><span class="todo">Add intro paragraph here; the bare table isn't very
welcoming</span></p>

    <td>End of construct <span class="fn">A construct is a bracket pair, an
    <code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code>/<code>else</code> block, or a comment. For example, if you hit <tt>%</tt> on 
    an opening bracket you'd jump to the corresponding closing bracket. See
    <tt>:help %</tt> for more details.</span></td>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The shortcuts<span class="fn">See recipe~\ref{sec:nav-text}</span> available
for text files are supported for source code, too, so review them if you
haven't already.</p>

<p>There's a lot to remember here. Despite my best efforts, I suspect that the
descriptions above are still confusing. To understand these shortucts you
really need to try them yourself.  Open some source code written in your
favourite language with Vim, make sure that syntax highlighting is on <span
  class="todo">link to relevant recipe</span>, and bounce back and forth
between those braces.</p>
