<h3 id="navigating-source-code">Navigating Source Code</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You're editing the source code for a computer program, and want to navigate
it efficiently.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>The commands below allow movement around source code in the context of
typical constructs. For instance, <kbd>%</kbd> finds the end of the
<code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code>/<code>else</code> block, or a comment, your
cursor is over, and moves you to the end of it.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Move To</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>%</kbd></td>
    <td>End of construct <span class="fn">A construct is a bracket pair, an
    <code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code>/<code>else</code> block, or a comment.
    For example, if you hit <kbd>%</kbd> on 
    an opening bracket you'd jump to the corresponding closing bracket. See
    <tt>:help %</tt> for more details.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>[[</kbd></td>
    <td>Backwards to the beginning of the current function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>][</kbd></td>
    <td>Forwards to the beginning of the current function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>}[</kbd></td>
    <td>Beginning of the current block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>}]</kbd></td>
    <td>End of the current block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>}[</kbd></td>
    <td>Beginning of the current comment block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>}]</kbd></td>
    <td>End of the current comment block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>gd</tt></td>
    <td>First usage of the current variable name <span class="fn">Ocurrences
        in comments are ignored.</span>. (Mnemonic: <i>g</i>o to
      <i>d</i>efinition).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>gD</kbd></td>
    <td>Go to the first <em>global</em> <span class="fn"><kbd>gd</kbd> looks for
        the definition closest to your current position, thus respecting the
        lexical scoping rules of many languages. <kbd>gD</kbd> starts searching
        from the first line of the file, so prefers variables with a global
        scope.</span> usage of the current variable name.</td>
  </tr>
</table>  

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The shortcuts<span class="fn">See recipe~\ref{sec:nav-text}</span> available
for text files are supported for source code, too, so review them if you
haven't already.</p>

<p>There's a lot to remember here. Despite my best efforts, I suspect that the
descriptions above are still confusing. To understand these shortcuts you
really need to try them yourself.  Open some source code written in your
favourite language with Vim, make sure that syntax highlighting is on
(<tt>:syntax on</tt>), and bounce back and forth between those braces.</p>
