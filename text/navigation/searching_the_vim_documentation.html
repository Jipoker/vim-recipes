<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want help with Vim but don't know where to look.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use the <tt>:helpgrep pattern</tt> command.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>To look up documentation for a specific Vim feature you can use <tt>:help
feature-name</tt>. But this is only useful if you know the name of the feature.</p>

<p><tt>helpgrep</tt> takes a pattern and matches it against the locally installed
documentation in much the same way as <tt>vimgrep</tt> did in Searching Over Multiple
Files (recipe~\ref{sec:search-mult}. If it finds any matches, it adds them to
the <i>quick fix list</i><span class="fn">See the Quick Fix List sidebar in
recipe~\ref{sec:search-mult} for more information</span>, and jumps
to the first one.</p>

<p>If you've installed a Vim addon, you'll need to run <tt>:helptags docs-path</tt>
before <tt>helpgrep</tt> will see its documentation.</p>
