<h3>Navigating Folds</h3>

<p><span class="todo">We need to address all the other kinds of folding. Maybe
have one recipe for manual folding, one for, say, syntax folding, then one for
actually navigating said folds?</span></p>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>Your document contains <i>folds</i> and you want to use them for navigation. (To
create folds see <a href="#man-fold">Manually Creating Folds</a>). </p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Mnemonic</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zc</tt></td>
    <td>Close the current fold.</td>
    <td><i>c</i>lose fold</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zo</tt></td>
    <td>Open the current fold.</td>
    <td><i>o</i>pen fold</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zM</tt></td>
    <td>Close all folds.</td>
    <td>fold <i>M</i>ore</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zR</tt></td>
    <td>Open all folds.</td>
    <td><i>R</i>educe folding</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zj</tt></td>
    <td>Move to the next fold.</td>
    <td><tt>j</tt> moves to the <i>next</i> line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zk</tt></td>
    <td>Move to the previous fold.</td>
    <td><tt>k</tt> moves to the <i>previous</i> line</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zn</tt></td>
    <td>Disable folding.</td>
    <td><i>n</i>o folds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>zN</tt></td>
    <td>Re-enable folding.</td>
    <td><i>N</i> is <i>n</i> toggled</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>You can use <tt>zM</tt> to achieve a "birds-eye" view of the file, which can be
useful when you're writing a long book and forget how the recipe you're
currently writing relates to&hellip; Anyway, try it.</p>

<p>Vim treats folds like individual lines, so <tt>j</tt> and <tt>k</tt> move over
one fold at a time. Further, you can yank/delete<span class="fn"><i>yank</i>
is Vim terminology for copying text to the clipboard.
Recipe~\ref{sec:copy-paste} explains cutting, copying, and pasting in
Vim.</span> a fold as if it was a single line.</p>

<p>By default, folds are forgotten when you edit another file. To save them use
<tt>:mkview</tt>. Then, to restore them, use <tt>:loadview</tt>.  <span
class="todo"><tt>mkview</tt> recipe instead of including it here</span></p>

<p>The <tt>:set foldcolumn=<var>W</var></tt> command, where <var>W</var> is a integer width less than
13, displays a column along the left-hand side of the screen with information
about the folds in the current file. It indicates whether the corresponding
line is an open or closed fold (with <i>-</i> or <i>+</i>, respectively).</p>
