<h3>Searching Over Multiple Files</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to search for a particular term in a collection of files.
<span class="todo">Provide example</span></p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use the <tt>vimgrep</tt> command: <tt>:vimgrep /<var>pattern</var>/
<var>[flags]</var> <var>file0</var> <var>file1</var> <var>fileN</var></tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>In its simplest form, <tt>vimgrep</tt> takes a word to search for, and a list
of files in which to do so. So, to search for <i>grapes</i> in
<tt>shopping-list.txt</tt> you'd run <tt>:vimgrep /grapes/
shopping-list.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>You can name as many files as you like, but you'll probably want to use
<i>shell globbing</i><span class="footnote">See the sidebar for details</span>
instead to specify groups of files.  Searching for <i>grapes</i> in all
<tt>*.txt</tt> files could be acomplished with: <tt>:vimgrep /grapes/
*.txt</tt>. </p>

<h5>Globbing</h5>

A number of Vim commands support filename <i>globbing</i>. This is a way of
selecting a group of files by specifying a pattern matching their names. For
example, <tt>*.txt</tt> refers to all files in the current directory whose
names end in <i>.txt</i>. The <tt>*</tt> is a <i>wildcard</i> and means
<i>anything</i>. 

<tt>**</tt> recursively matches directories below the current one, so
<tt>**/*.txt</tt> searches recursively downwards from the current directory
for filenames ending in <i>.txt</i>. 

If your operating system supports additional globbing patterns, you can use
these as well. 

You're not restricted to searching on simple words, however. You can use any
of Vim's regular expressions<span class="fn">See recipe~\ref{sec:regex} for an
introduction to regular expressions and Vim's implementation of them</span>
between the forward slashes. Searching <tt>/tmp/bar.txt</tt> and
<tt>~/foo.tex</tt> for lines starting with numbers: <tt>:vimgrep /^[0-9]/
/tmp/bar.txt ~/foo.tex</tt>. 

<tt>vimgrep</tt> jumps to the first match it finds. To jump to the next match
use <kbd>:cn</kbd>; use <kbd>:cN</kbd> for the previous. <span
class="todo">There must be an easier way</span>

The <kbd>j</kbd> flag inhibits the jumpiness (<i>Ritalin</i> for Vim); simply
saving the search results to the <i>quickfix list</i><span
class="footnote">See the sidebar for details</span>, and leaving your cursor
where it was.

The <kbd>g</kbd> flag controls how lines matching the pattern multiple times are
handled. If not present (by default), only the first match of a line is shown;
otherwise, every occurence of the pattern is regarded as a seperate match.

The flags can be combined in either order.

<h5>Quick Fix List</h5>

 The <i>quick fix</i> list mentioned above is a Vim concept for creating a
temporary index of positions in a file. <tt>vimgrep</tt> stores its results (a
file name, a position within that file, and the matched text) in the quick fix
list.

To view the quick fix list (i.e. the results of the last search) use
<tt>:cl[ist]</tt>. The results are numbered, so you can jump to a specific one with
<tt>:cc <var>number</var></tt>.

For more information see <tt>:help quickfix</tt>.
