<h3>Modifying the Cursor</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to make the cursor easier to see.</p>

<p>For example, you're using visually "busy" syntax highlighing, and sometimes
lose the cursor. Or, you're working with columular data, and need the entire
column that the cursor is over to be highlighted.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To change the cursor colour in Gvim redefine the <i>Cursor</i> highlighting
group<span class="fn">Recipe:~\ref{sec:re-highlight}; in standard Vim the terminal
defines the cursor colour.</span> <span class="todo">Is this always true?</span></p>

<p>Another approach is to highlight the line the cursor is on.  You do this by
executing <tt>:set cursorline</tt>. Again, to change the colours modify the
<i>CursorLine</i> highlighting group.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can highlight the current column the cursor is in with <tt>:set
cursorcolumn</tt>. The highlight group is, predictably, called <i>CursorColumn</i>.</p>

<p>If you want your terminal to resemble a sniper's sights, you can combine both
line and column highlighting to create a crosshair effect, as shown below.

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Gvim allows you to customise every conceivable aspect of the cursor display
with the command <tt>:set guicursor</tt>. This allows you to change the
cursor's appearance based on the mode (i.e. one colour for Insert mode,
another for Normal), its height, and control whether it blinks&hellip; This is
achieved by providing a <i>format string</i> as the value for
<tt>guioptions</tt>.  Here are some examples:</p>

<p><span class="todo">Test examples</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>n-c-v:ver50-ncvCursor</tt> - In Normal, Command, and Insert mode set the
  cursor to a vertical bar 50% of the current character's width. Highlight it
  with the <i>ncvCursor</i> group.</li>
  <li><tt>i:block-iCursor-blinkon0,v:block-vCursor</tt> - In Insert mode use a
  non-blinking block cursor highlighted with the <i>iCursor</i>
  highlighting group. In Visual mode also use a block cursor,
  but highlight it with <i>vCursor</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above examples should be adaptable for your uses. For the gritty detail of
the supported syntax look at <tt>:help guicursor</tt>. <span class="todo">Do
we say this, or add some of our now famous tables?</span></p>
